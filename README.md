# An-AI-based-System-of-Road-Sign-Detection

An-AI-based-System-of-Road-Sign-Detection is a real-time road sign detection application built using Flask and YOLOv8. This project demonstrates the use of computer vision techniques to identify and classify various road signs from a video feed or uploaded images.

## Features

- Real-time detection of road signs using YOLOv8
- Web-based interface for uploading images and displaying results
- Visual representation of detected signs with bounding boxes and labels
- Confidence scores for each detected sign

## Dataset
This dataset is available on Kaggle. You can access it using the following link:
[Road Sign Detection Dataset of 49 Classes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadabdullah407/road-sign-detection-dataset-of-49-classes)


## Note
- You have to extract each rar file and must maintain the following format to keep this model working.

## Add Efficiency
- Due to the shortage of resourse this model is trained for 20 Epochs you can increse it epoch to make the model much more efficent.
- Must have an eye on the model perfformance to not to overfit it.

## Road Sign Classes
This model can detect and classify the 49 types of road signs

## Technical Details
-  Framework: Flask for the web application
-  Object Detection: YOLOv8 for detecting and classifying road signs
-  Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the web interface
- Dependencies: See requirements.txt for the full list of dependencies
